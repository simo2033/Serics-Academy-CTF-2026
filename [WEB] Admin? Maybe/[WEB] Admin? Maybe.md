# [WEB] Admin? Maybe

## Description

An internal dashboard was shared for review. The admin panel exists, but access control feels oddly implemented. Can you reach the admin area?

You can access the application at: https://admin-maybe.sactf.staccahstaccah.it

`Username: user`

`Password: SecureP@ss2026!`

## Solution

The site appears like this

We can use the provided credential to login

But of course we log in as a normal user

And clearly the access to Admin Panel is denied to us.
